Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-Hangman

This is a hangman module for the IRC Bot Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable...

IT IS NOT FINISHED... The docs aren't correct and half the functionality
is missing/doesn't work... You can however play a general public game with it
:-)

It's a work in progress .... Watch this space...
